- SQLite database (not suitable for production scale)
- Default SECRET_KEY (must change for production)
- CORS allows localhost only
- No email service configured

### Production Considerations
- Requires email service setup
- Should migrate to PostgreSQL
- Needs proper SECRET_KEY
- Requires HTTPS/TLS
- Should use Redis for WebSocket scaling
- Needs monitoring and logging setup

---

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions
- SQLite for simplicity in development
- JWT for stateless authentication
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- React Context for state management
- Pydantic for validation
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database abstraction

### Architecture Choices
- Monolithic backend (FastAPI)
- SPA frontend (React)
- RESTful API design
- WebSocket for real-time
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for compliance
